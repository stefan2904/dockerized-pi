** About the bot2904 Account
The [[https://github.com/bot2904][bot2904]] account is a dedicated bot account used by [[https://github.com/stefan2904][stefan2904]]'s pi agent.
It exists to perform automated tasks, experiment with GitHub APIs, and manage projects in a sandbox environment, effectively "testing its limits" without cluttering (or risking) the main account.
